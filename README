Version 1.0

NOTES
- This is research code, and comes with the usual caveats. The code is a work in progress, 
and I would love to clean it up when I have more time, but for now - it does what it needs to 
do for my purposes. Feel free to use it, upgrade it, improve it - let me know if you do! - but 
if it breaks, don't be too surprised. Enjoy!
- This interpreter supports a limited subset of the Lustre language, namely:
	- Currently, the interpreter only supports single-node Lustre models.
	- Subsets are not supported
- OMC/DC refers to the Observable MC/DC source code coverage metric for software testing. 
Given a set of inputs and the use of the omcdc command line flag, the interpreter will track which
OMC/DC obligations are satisfied and produce a report. 
For more information, see: http://www.greggay.com/pdf/13omcdc.pdf

-----------------------------
To compile:

make compile

To clean up when done:

make clean

To execute: (following compile)

java LustreSimulator.java <model filename> <inputs filename> <operation mode> <variable file - optional for simulate mode, specifies an ordering and which variables are in the trace; required for OMC/DC tracking, specifies the oracle variables>

----------------------------
Input file should be in format
varname1,varname2,...
value11,value21,...
...
value1n, value2n,...
----------------------------
Variable file shouls be in format
varname1,varname2,...

---------------------------
Operation modes are:
simulate (standard Lustre simulation)
order (reorders expressions so that all variables are defined before use)
omcdc (tracks satisfaction of Observable MC/DC test obligations)
